To figure out whether GIoU can work well or not and how it will work. I and my teammate Yuan Gao did these works.
  • We introduce the architecture of YOLO v3.
  • We introduce IoU and GIoU and use them with localization loss as the loss functions of YOLO v3 to testwhich of them can get     the best performance.
  • We do an exploration about focal loss.
  • We propose two ideas which are the strategy of asymptotic fine tuning and the assumption of separating the branch of           different loss functions.
